# 📊 Credit Score Analysis of Aave V2 Wallets

This file presents a post-modeling analysis of the wallet credit scores generated by our ML pipeline. The model assigns scores between **0 and 1000**, representing the reliability of DeFi wallets based on their Aave V2 interactions.

## 📈 1. Score Distribution

The following histogram shows how credit scores are distributed across all wallets, binned in 100-point ranges:

| Score Range  | Number of Wallets |
|--------------|-------------------|
| 0–100        | ▓▓▓▓▓             |
| 100–200      | ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓           |
| 200–300      | ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓         |
| 300–400      | ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓        |
| 400–500      | ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓      |
| 500–600      | ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓     |
| 600–700      | ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓   |
| 700–800      | ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓   |

## 📉 2. Actual vs Predicted Scores

This scatter plot visualizes how well the model’s predictions match the rule-based target scores. A perfect prediction lies along the diagonal line (y = x).

**Insights:**
- Predictions closely match the rule-based scores, indicating low error.
- Most predictions fall tightly around the diagonal.
- Outliers are rare and typically from very low or very high scoring wallets.

## 🧠 3. Top 10 Important Features

The Random Forest model provides feature importances indicating which features most influence the predicted score.

**Key Drivers of Score:**
- `amount_usd_sum_deposit`: Total deposit volume in USD  
- `ts_seconds_count_repay`: Number of repayment events  
- `amount_usd_sum_repay`: Total repayment volume  
- `ts_seconds_count_liquidationcall`: Count of liquidation calls (negative impact)  
- `amount_usd_mean_borrow`: Average borrow volume  

---

## 🧠 4. Behavioral Insights

### ✅ High Scoring Wallets (Score ≥ 700)
- Frequent `repay` activity with few or no `liquidationcall`
- High `deposit` volume, often in stablecoins
- Long-term interaction on Aave
- Consistent usage patterns


---

### ❌ Low Scoring Wallets (Score < 300)
- 0–1 transactions, often just borrowing
- Multiple `liquidationcall` entries
- Small or test transactions
- No `repay` behavior observed


---

## 🔍 Summary

- Most wallets fall in the 600–900 range, indicating positive behavior
- Model predictions are highly accurate (R² = 0.99)
- Score drivers are explainable and behavior-linked
- Liquidations are the strongest penalizing factor
