# aave-credit-score-model
A machine learning pipeline that assigns credit scores (0â€“1000) to DeFi wallets based on historical behavior on the Aave V2 protocol. The model uses engineered wallet features from transaction data and a Random Forest regressor to score wallet reliability, penalize risky actions, and enable transparent, explainable credit scoring on-chain.
